# Teach Yourself, Teach Us

Today is an all-day structured exercise in developing the skill you're likely to use most in the Industry: teaching yourself something new.

**Note: The deliverable for this (see below) counts as one homework grade.**

By yourself or with one or more others of your choosing, please pick a useful library or technology we have not covered in class. Then:

### Build something

...that demonstrates your subject. It should:
- Be published to a Github repository.
- Be very small, with no more than 50 total lines of code, if possible (**excluding comments**).
- Be well-commented with notes.
- Be a good example of why someone might want to use your code.
- **Not** follow the [DTROTFO](https://i.imgur.com/RadSf.jpg) methodology.

### Document it

In your Github repository, include a `readme.md` that answers the following questions regarding your subject. No need to write a book!

- Why did you choose this subject?

Data viz, graphic imaging software, and other animation libraries often use Python extensively. I wanted some familiarity.

  - How were you first made aware of it?

As one of those big three languages - across PHP, Python, Ruby - then shortly after via Maya and Cinema 4D for animation.

- What problem does it solve?

It's a general purpose programming language. It's very fast, not as influenced by C as many other languages, and designed to be easy to use.

  - How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?

  It's more readable than its forebears and requires less code to achieve similar results to C.

- Why does one use it?

  It's a massively adopted programming language (top 5 in popularity) with benefits mentioned above.

  - What are the alternatives?

  Ruby, PHP, others.

  - What is it similar to, if anything?

  Ruby, Perl, and C

- What is the history of this technology?

  Invented in the late 80s by Guido van Rossum as a descendant of the ABC language that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. Since then, it's gained massive industry traction.

  - Who built it and why?

  As above.

  - Who is maintaining it?

  Guido van Rossum, AKA the BDFL, as well as large companies like Google and the iterative improvement process, the "Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process."

- What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?

Really enjoy it, but I've just scratched the surface. Curious to use it more.

- What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

Not knowing C or the other ancestor languages that inspired it.

- What resources do you recommend for interested students?

CodeAcademy, also, the internet. A lot of it is written in Python.

  - What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?

  CodeAcademy

- What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

These questions will be general purpose language questions, much like you'd see for Ruby, PHP, or JavaScript. Examples: http://www.toptal.com/python/interview-questions

Also, please include the instructions necessary to:

- Run your example.

Optional:
Python 2 is installed by default. You can install Python3 if you want by visiting: https://www.python.org/downloads/

PIP can help you install other Python libraries. But it's not necessary right now.

To run the example in the terminal, navigate to the directory containing example.py, and type in the terminal "python example.py"

  - Do I need to run `bower install`? Do I need an API key?

  No.

- Use your subject.

See above.

  - Do I need to include it in my HTML with `<script>` tags? Do I need to `brew install` anything? Can I deploy it to Heroku?

  See above.


**NO LATER THAN 2:00: ALL STUDENTS** must submit a Git issue to the `teach_yourself` repository containing a link to their / their group's main repository. The issue must also include:

- Your comfort score (out of 5)
- Any particular sections of your code that you would like the instructors to review, and specific questions to guide our feedback.

**2:00: ALL STUDENTS** should take the next half-hour to review other students' submissions.

**2:30: ALL STUDENTS** will re-convene in their classroom to debrief.
